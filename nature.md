It's more important than ever before to not only source materials for structural purposes but to do so because they are the right choice for the environment.

&ldquo;This doesn’t mean compromising on style.  For example, our collaboration with the wonderful Elvis & Kresse to use their rescued leather for our upholstery is not only a sustainable choice but one that enhances the beauty of our Beam Bench design.&rdquo;

Sustainably sourced timber from local suppliers, a super-insulated no heating workshop, machinery powered by renewably generated electricity and the use of reclaimed materials are just a few examples of the processes in place to minimise environmental impact at the Katie Walker Furniture workshop.

We are corporate members of <a href='https://www.woodlandheritage.org' target='_new'>Woodland Heritage</a> and encourage you to support them too.
