Sitting Firm was set up by master-craftsman Dave Green in 1989, and soon gained an enviable international reputation for producing fine quality traditional Windsor chairs.

[Sitting Firm](http://www.sittingfirm.co.uk "Makers of the Windsor rocker") see chair-making as a living tradition. They have worked with Katie Walker to create an exceptional range of Modern Windsors. In this area Sitting Firm have led the way in the current renewal of interest in this traditional British craft; at the same time moving it forward for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
