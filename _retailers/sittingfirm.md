Katie visited Sitting Firm Chairmakers Ltd. in 2012. It was then that she first met Dave Green and hatched a plan to take the Windsor rocker forward to batch production launching with its first retailer - Heals in Tottenham Court Road, London. 

A friend had introduced Katie to the joys of Windsor chair making and from that the idea of the Windsor rocker was born. From those initial days she was hooked on this very honest, timeless method of construction and working with Dave over the next 7 years cemented that passion.

<hr>

Dave was always ready for a challenge and even gave a steam bent version of the <a href="/furniture/weightandsee.html">Weight & see mirror</a> a go!

Although Dave Green no longer makes the pieces in the Katie Walker Furniture range, his influence has been considerable and we like to feel Sitting Firm lives on in the Windsor pieces that are available in the collection.
