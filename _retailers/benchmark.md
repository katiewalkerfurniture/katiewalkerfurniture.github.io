Sean Sutcliffe and Terence Conran founded [Benchmark]("http://www.benchmarkfurniture.com") in 1984 with a dream of creating a craft based workshop that produced furniture on a scale that would provide customers with high quality, beautifully designed furniture made in a responsible way and at a reasonable price. They make and sell their own furniture collection and enjoy working with many of the world's top architects and designers on a range of projects, fitting and furnishing offices, hotels, bars, restuarants and public buildings.
