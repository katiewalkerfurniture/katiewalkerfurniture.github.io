[Gaze Burvill](http://www.gazeburvill.com "Makers of the Levity range") was founded in 1992 by Christian Gaze and Simon Burvill with the aim of creating the finest outdoor furniture, which did not have a damaging impact on the environment and in the early days was frequently seen at the same exhibitions as Katie Walker Furniture. Today they are one of the UK's leading furniture makers, specializing in high quality outdoor oak furniture.

[Gaze Burvill](http://www.gazeburvill.com "Makers of the Levity range") have continued to develop pieces with the same high level of design as introduced by Christian Gaze with their initial Court Seat and the best quality standards integral to their approach to furniture production. They have also kept abreast of the most modern and innovative manufacturing techniques with CNC machinery fully used from their eco-workshop in Hampshire.
