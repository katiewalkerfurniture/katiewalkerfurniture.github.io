[Matthew Burt](//www.matthewburt.com/#home) are a small creative team of designers, makers and managers creating free-standing and fitted furniture from individual pieces to roomsets or an entire house full.  It was founded and is still run by Matthew and Celia Burt, Matthew as creative director and Celia as administrative director.  They have evolved from a two-man band operating out of a self-built garden shed into an expanding team based at a converted farmyard on the outskirts of the village of Hindon in south west Wiltshire.   Their showroom is in the same village settled between two delightful pubs.

We collaborate with Matthew Burt in the making of some of the pieces in our collection such as the [Beam Bench](/work/beambench.html "Beam Bench") and the [Weight and see mirrors](/work/weightandsee.html "Weight and see mirror") which are also available from Matthew Burt's showroom.
