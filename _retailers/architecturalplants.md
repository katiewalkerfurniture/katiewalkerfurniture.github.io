[Architectural Plants]("//www.architecturalplants.com") nursery is near Pulborough in West Sussex and specialises in plants that are both shapely and exotic - Japanese and European Topiary, hardy palms, bananas, bamboos, plants for screening, and a range of rare evergreen trees. They are the home of the interesting, unusual, quirky and bizarre - the tropical and the jungly, of both big and small specimen plants. Winners of a number of awards for their innovative approach and high level of presentation. The Antidote to Garden Centres.

Their interest in plants is almost entirely sculptural. As you wend your way around the nursery you'll find sculpture amongst the plants.
