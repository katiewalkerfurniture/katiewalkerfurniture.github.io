I work with a core team of dedicated craftsmen. In many cases it is only feasible to realise my design ideas by working closely with these highly skilled and specialised makers to push the boundaries of what are essentially traditional processes.


Guided by the belief that “timber is our primary natural renewable resource and the most ecologically sound solution is to design with longevity in mind”, all Katie Walker furniture is made from sustainably sourced timber, most of which is from the UK. Timber is only sourced from forests certified by the FSC and I am proud to support British forestry with the knowledge that it will provide a well managed sustainable resource for the future. We are corporate members of <a href='https://www.woodlandheritage.org' target='_new'>Woodland Heritage</a> and encourage you to support them too.
