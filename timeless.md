sizes="100vw">From our iconic Ribbon and Windsor rockers, through to witty pieces such as the Weight & See Mirror or the geometrical lines of the Hoop Chair, our passion is to make something that you will love. 

Our designs sometimes take inspiration from the past, other times the present but they are always classics with a timeless appeal.

The Ribbon Rocker is a classic example of this.  Inspired by the Naum Gabos sculpture &lsquo;spheric theme&rsquo;, its structure is made from one continuous piece and the effect is a fluid form, which appears to be floating on air.  Look more closely though and you will see that it is a rigid chair of great strength.
