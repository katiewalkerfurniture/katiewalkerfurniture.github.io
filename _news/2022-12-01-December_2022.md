I was very pleased to be asked by Helen Chislett and David Linley if they could include some of my work in their new book "Craft Britain: Why Making Matters". A little later they asked all those featured to contribute unique boxes or bags to contain a single signed copy of the book to be sold in aid of the Prince's Foundation. Having started Katie Walker Furniture with support from the Prince's Foundation, I was delighted to make something and have produced a book-end to display the book. 32 beautifully crafted boxes are being shown in an exhibition which launches the new book alongside a piece of work by every maker including the [Ribbon Rocking Chair](https://www.katiewalkerfurniture.com/furniture/ribbonrocker.html) in ash.

Bespoke For A Book opens on Wednesday 7th December with a press view from 10am to noon (rsvp needed) at [The Garrison Chapel, Chelsea Barracks, London](https://www.chelseabarracks.com/visit/garrison-chapel). It is open to the public every day from 11am to 4pm until Thursday 15th.

The book can be purchased for £40 from most good book sellers.

## Collaborating with Elvis & Kresse

The covers to our [Beam Bench](https://www.katiewalkerfurniture.com/furniture/beambench.html) by Elvis & Kresse have continued to be admired but sadly the “Shiraz” coloured leather is no longer available (I have one cover in Shiraz left). To be able to take offcuts from a major luxury brand and make such wonderful covers is very inspiring. At least 800,000 tonnes of leather waste is produced globally and the modular system uses three shapes to lock together leather fragments into components that can be woven together into a whole new kind of hide, unrestricted by size or shape. 50% of the profits from this system are donated to Barefoot College in the form of scholarships to train women as solar engineers, simultaneously helping to empower women and generate renewable power.

We all love [Elvis & Kresse’s](https://www.elvisandkresse.com/) products and highly recommend taking a look if you are still looking for Christmas presents but don't forget our ever popular [Weight and See mirror](https://www.katiewalkerfurniture.com/furniture/weightandsee.html) which we could still get to you in time!

### More to come...

We realise that we have been very remiss in sending out newsletters. Plenty has been happening - the [Hoop chair](https://www.katiewalkerfurniture.com/furniture/hoopchair.html), with a wool Bouclé cover, is very cosy to snuggle up in in the winter months and our collection now includes a tree-seat, a revision of our A-x bench and some developments in our "Windsor" range. We promise to send you more in the New Year but if you can't wait, [do let us know](http://www.katiewalkerfurniture.com/contact/).
