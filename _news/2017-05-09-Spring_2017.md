## Visit to No. 10 Downing Street

In February Dave Green of [Sitting Firm Chairmakers](/retailers/sittingfirm.html "Makers of George's chair") and I were treated to a tour of No. 10 Downing Street. The result of our having supplied some furniture for the GREAT Britain campaign headquarters. [The chairs](/work/georgeschair.html "George's chair - as seen in 10 DOwning St") were shown in my last newsletter but if you didn’t see them they are pictured again below under the must have snapshot of myself at the front door itself!

There is a set of [four posters and two social media banners](/work/great.html "GREAT campaign").

## Gaze Burvill to launch Levity at the Chelsea Flower Show, 23rd to 27th May

Over the last six months I have been working very closely with the outdoor furniture company, [Gaze Burvill](/retailers/gazeburvill.html "Gaze Burvill") to produce a new collection. The first two [Levity](/work/levity.html "The Levity range") pieces, a dining chair and table will be launched at the Chelsea flower show later this month. They have been nominated for a number of awards so hopefully more news will follow. To see Levity, visit Gaze Burvill's Patricia Fox designed stand number 333 at the [RHS Chelsea Flower Show](https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show "The Chelsea Flower Show").

## Windsor rocker - Heal's 100

The [Windsor rocker](/work/windsorrocker.html "The Windsor rocker") has been chosen as one of [Heal's](/retailers/heals.html "Heal's") 100 Design icons. Heal's are inviting members of the public to vote for their favourite so if you are passing their flagship store in Tottenham Court Road before Thursday do pop in and cast yours. While you are there, check out [George's high chair](/work/georgeshighchair.html "George's high chair") which is also on display.
