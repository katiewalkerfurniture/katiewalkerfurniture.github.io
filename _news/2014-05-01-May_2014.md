## Awarded a Design Guild Mark
The Windsor rocker was recently awarded a Design Guild Mark by The Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers.
 
The annual award was set up to reward excellence in the design of furniture for production and this year the Windsor rocker was one of 27 outstanding products to be awarded. I am proud to be awarded a Design Guild Mark; it is fantastic for the chair to be recognised amongst the likes of the Supporto by the late Fred Scott. I am also proud of the fact that the Windsor rocker is produced by Sitting Firm chairmakers in the UK.

## Eliza rocker for John Lewis' 150 years celebration

The Eliza rocker is one of a range of exclusive products celebrating the 150th anniversary of John Lewis. It is designed specifically for Sitting Firm to produce and celebrates both Sitting Firm's manufacturing capabilities and the ethos of John Lewis.

The Eliza range, named after John Lewis' wife, demonstrates Sitting Firm's expertise in the methods of steam bending with its double curved backrest which flows into the arms and down into the front legs. The chair is reassuring yet contemporary - modern design celebrating traditional craftsmanship and values.

*'beautifully minimalist design'*
 
The Eliza range is available from John Lewis.
