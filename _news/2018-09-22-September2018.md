As mentioned in my last newsletter, I am launching a new lounge chair. This will be first shown at the ‘Evolution of Tradition’ exhibition, a collaboration between the Furniture Makers Company and the Design Centre, Chelsea Harbour. This exhibition runs from Tuesday the 2nd to Friday the 5th of October. You can register to visit [here](https://katiewalkerfurniture.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6e46660a0191b66cf05bea135&id=dfa79e0f6d&e=153ba42748 "Register").

If you would like to attend the private view on the evening of Monday the 1st October please do get back to me as soon as possible. I will then give your names to the Design Centre, Chelsea Harbour for their security checks on the door.
