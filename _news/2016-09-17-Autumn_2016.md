## Prince George's high chair re-visited

The design will be on display at Heals, Tottenham Court Road, during the London Design Festival 17th - 25th September.

In response to demand, we have re-visited the design of the Royal high chair and Sitting Firm Chairmakers now produce a version fit for our very own little prince and princesses (from tot to teen).

We are thrilled to say that it has been tested and passed by the Furniture Industry Research Association, meeting all of the relevant British Standard safety requirements.

As with Prince George's high chair, it is made in ash and finished with a white tinted hard wax oil, although an optional accompanying tray attachment is now also available. I do hope they managed to cope in the Palace without!

## Great showcase at 10 Downing Street


Katie Walker Furniture joined forces with Sitting Firm Chairmakers Ltd to produce a new chair design for the meeting rooms of the GREAT campaign at 10 Downing Street.

Originally designed in ash with a solid wood seat to accompany George's high chair, at the request of GREAT, the set of 8 chairs was produced specifically in walnut and with an upholstered seat. The chairs were made by Sitting Firm Chairmakers in their Midlands workshop. The upholstery fabric (colour way selected by the GREAT team) was also supplied and produced by a British fabric company and mill.

Originally designed to accompany George's high chair in ash with a solid ash seat, either version is available direct from Katie Walker Furniture.

## Ribbon rocking chair selected for show at Ornament, the Great Northern Craft Fair 6th - 9th October

In 2010, aided by the Art Fund, Manchester Art Gallery purchased a Ribbon rocking chair for its permanent craft collection. This October the piece will be venturing out, having been selected to go on display at: [Ornament within the Great Northern Craft Fair](http://www.greatnorthernevents.co.uk/homepage-gnccf.aspx).

"Following its successful launch at GNCCF 2014, Ornament returns to give GNCCF visitors a chance to invest in museum quality collectible craft from a selection of the UK's most eminent makers. This selling exhibition, curated by Michelle Keeling in partnership with curators of contemporary craft collections in museums & galleries across the North, will feature outstanding work to inspire, engage and tempt new and existing collectors."

The piece is available to order in either ash or walnut from Katie Walker Furniture.

## Winged seat at Architectural Plants

We are fortunate to have [Architectural Plants](http://www.architecturalplants.com/sculpture-at-architectural-plants) just up the road from the studio here in Pulborough, West Sussex. Architectural Plants have built a reputation as one of the leading specialist plant suppliers in the UK. They have recently started to show sculpture in their beautiful new location and are currently showing a few of the Katie Walker Furniture garden pieces including the Winged seat and Warnham bench. The garden is definitely worth a visit, as founder Angus White puts it "a curious fusion: Architectural Plants meets Aix-en-Provance, Brancusi, Le Corbusier, Kyoto, Port Stanley and the A29".
