Author Interiors are showing some of our pieces in their carefully curated collectors lounge which this year is in an even bigger and better space at the London Art Fair. They will also be welcoming many of the Creators and Makers behind the pieces, including Katie, to the Fair on Friday 20th at a ‘Meet the maker’ event.

The London Art Fair, now in its 35th year, provides an established home for Modern British Art, and was founded by the London Business Design Centre in Islington where the Fair still takes place today. It hosts an exceptional line-up of over 100 Modern and Contemporary galleries from around the globe, and kicks the year off with a bang!

Details about the show and its opening times can be found at the London Art Fair Website.

Katie will be at the show all day on Friday 20th. The doors to Authors ‘Meet the Maker’ event opens at 5pm with welcome drinks and there will be a brief introduction before the opportunity to chat to the various makers there. Although the event officially closes at 6pm, they do expect people to stay longer.

It would be lovely to see you there!
