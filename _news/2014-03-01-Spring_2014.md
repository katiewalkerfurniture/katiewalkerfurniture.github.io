## A high chair for HRH Prince George
To celebrate the birth of HRH Prince George, The Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers ran a competition to "select a designer with the very best design to make a high chair celebrating excellence of British furniture design and craftsmanship".
 
As many of you know, last year I won the commission to design a high chair for HRH Prince George and I was thrilled to be able to deliver the piece in person to Kensington Palace in February. Photographs of the meeting with the Duchess of Cambridge were not permitted so the photograph above is one taken in my studio. It was a very challenging brief - meeting the criteria laid out by British Standards for the design of such a piece whilst making it a beautifully 'crafted' object. It was awarded a 'Bespoke Guild Mark' by The Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers in December.
 
The Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers have issued a press release with more details.

## 10% off all orders placed at Midcentury Modern #
Sunday 16th March 10 - 4 pm<br/>
Dulwich College, London, SE21 7LD 
 
As part of our 20 years celebration we will be giving 10% off all orders placed on the day. This is a very different show for us to be taking part in with new pieces jostling for space with 20th century classics. It is a great day out for all with plenty of enthusiastic exhibitors.
 
Showing for the first time will be a Ribbon rocking chair in walnut and a Windsor footstool designed to accompany the Windsor rocker. We will also have the Windsor rocker, a number of Weight and See mirrors in both ash and walnut and a rarely seen side table.
 
Details on visiting the exhibition can be found on [http://themodernmarketplace.com](The modern marketplace)

## Katie Walker Furniture at the Royal Academy, London
3rd, 4th and 5th April with a private view on the evening of the 2nd.
 
In 2012 I was awarded a place on 'Crafted' a mentoring programme supported by Walpole British Luxury. [http://www.thewalpole.co.uk/crafted-2012](Walpole)

In this exhibition, "Crafted: makers of the exceptional", my work will be shown alongside other 'Crafted' alumni in the wonderful gallery spaces of The Royal Academy. The exhibition is sponsored by Vacheron Constantin, one of the world's oldest and most respected manufacturers of luxury Swiss time pieces.

I will be exhibiting my Windsor rockers with their new accompanying footstool, a Ribbon rocking chair in walnut, a Marilyn table in walnut and I have been invited to show the development work and tell the story behind the Royal high chair commission.
