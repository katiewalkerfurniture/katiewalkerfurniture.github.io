* Designers House, New Art Centre
* Fragile - Royal Academy
* Coming up: Evolution of Tradition, Chelsea Harbour

It has been ages since my last newsletter - we've been really busy with our own products and designing for others. I have also been returning more to the sculptural roots from which the products derive and there are a couple of major art venues featuring my work this summer. I do hope you have time to visit them as they are full of fabulous, fun and eclectic work.

## Katie Walker at the 'Design House', the New Art Centre, Roche Court

In June this year the New Art Centre opened 'Design House’ specifically to bridge the boundaries between art and design. The launch ran alongside the opening of the Edmund de Waal exhibition: ‘Early work: vessels from the Rosenheimer collection’. The Design House is open daily, for information contact [New Art Centre, Roche Court](https://sculpture.uk.com/visit/). 

The [Ribbon Rocking chair](/work/ribbonrocker.html) is shown in both ash and walnut. The [Marilyn Table](/work/marilyn.html) is shown in Oak.

## Fragile at the Royal Academy's 250th Summer Exhibition

In December last year I decided to create a wholly unfunctional piece. I love the unfussiness, the utilitarian aesthetic, the honesty of the humble every day object, of the universal pallet - ‘throw away’ yet so intrinsically valuable to society - the unseen supporter. I became a champion of the everyday and fell in love with the colour blue.

I am delighted to say that the resulting piece, ‘FRAGILE’, is now on display at The Royal Academy's Summer exhibition. This year was curated by Grayson Perry and a committee of fellow artists and marks the 250th show. The Gallery showing FRAGILE was hung by Conrad Shawcross whose own work celebrates the geometry of nature.

Yes, I have over heard plenty of comments about how the packaging was left out during the exhibition build-up!

Fittingly, Grayson Perry has coordinated the biggest, brightest and most colourful [Summer Exhibition](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/summer-exhibition-2018) yet, in the 250th annual celebration of “art made now”.

The show runs until 19th August, open daily 10 - 6 and Friday 10 - 10.
