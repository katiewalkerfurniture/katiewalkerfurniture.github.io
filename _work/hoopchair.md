Hoop chair is an upholstered lounge chair combining a sleek formed seating shell with a light ash wood frame. The piece took its inspiration from both of the iconic rocking chairs in the Katie Walker Furniture range – the seating shell further explores the extents to which plywood can be formed and the ash hoop both acts as a structural member and an inviting shape for armrests to sit within. The challenge in the design was to achieve exceptional comfort whilst matching the two geometric shapes of the seating shell and the angled hoop – the shell seemingly dropped into and effortlessly supported by the hoop.

The upholstery fabric is also a new design by Bute fabrics and the cover has been tailored like a fine coat so as to be fully removable.
