Beam Bench is inspired by traditional cross-legged tables, blending Japanese style self-locking joints with curved legs. Originally conceived for gallery seating, Beam Bench is sized for a domestic setting – hallway seating and at the foot of the bed are popular positions. The lightness of its curves and the playfulness of the jointing are now further highlighted by the modular, rescued leather covering added by Elvis & Kresse. The leather cover is held in place by removable stainless steel tubes making it easy to change the cover, swapping colourways with the seasons.

In 2005 Kresse Wesling had a chance meeting with the London Fire Brigade and a very emotional response to their damaged, decommissioned fire hose. It was too heroic and too beautiful for landfill. Somebody had to do something, and those somebodies were Elvis & Kresse (Kresse and her partner James ‘aka Elvis’ Henrit).

They mounted a rescue, and over the last 15 years have saved all of London’s hoses, transforming them into a range of luxury accessories and donating 50% of the profits to the Fire Fighters Charity. From the first day Elvis & Kresse had a unique DNA: rescue, transform, donate.

They are now tackling their greatest ever challenge, the 800,000 tonnes of leather off-cuts generated each year by the global leather industry. Even when the patterns for leather goods are carefully planned to maximise the hides, the process inevitably creates small off cuts. These are high quality, unused, freshly tanned and dyed leather, but fall to the workshop floor as seemingly unusable pieces. Elvis & Kresse has designed a system that transforms these fragments into components, which are then hand woven into a new kind of hide that is unrestricted by size or shape.
