*&ldquo;The Ribbon Rocking Chair is actually extraordinary and very memorable - __a classic of our time__&rdquo;*
Kevin McCloud, Grand Designs

*&ldquo;It is so difficult to create a truly original chair: the minimalist, sculptural and beautifully balanced Ribbon Rocking Chair is a stunning re-invention of the traditional rocking chair and an __inspired__ combination of craft values with sleek contemporary design&rdquo;.*
Janet Boston, Manchester Art Gallery

*&ldquo;knowing what is possible yet pushing the boundaries of production can result in a simplicity that is greater than the sum of its parts - this award winning chair is __wooden poetry__&rdquo;*
Allen Boothroyd, Meridian Audio

*&ldquo;It is a revolution in rocking chairs - one seamless ribbon of timber from which the seat is slung. How will anyone ever do better? Rocking chair __design come of age!__&rdquo;*
Jon Snow
