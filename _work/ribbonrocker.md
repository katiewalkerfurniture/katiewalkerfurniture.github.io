*“The Ribbon rocking chair is actually extraordinary and very memorable - __a classic of our time__”*
Kevin McCloud, Grand Designs

*“It is so difficult to create a truly original chair`: the minimalist, sculptural and beautifully balanced Ribbon rocking chair is a stunning re-invention of the traditional rocking chair and an __inspired__ combination of craft values with sleek contemporary design”.*
Janet Boston, Manchester Art Gallery

*“knowing what is possible yet pushing the boundaries of production can result in a simplicity that is greater than the sum of its parts - this award winning chair is __wooden poetry__”*
Allen Boothroyd, Meridian Audio

*“It is a revolution in rocking chairs - one seamless ribbon of timber from which the seat is slung. How will anyone ever do better? Rocking chair __design come of age!__”*
Jon Snow
