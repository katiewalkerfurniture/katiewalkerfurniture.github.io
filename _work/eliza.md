The Eliza rocker is one of a range of exclusive products celebrating the 150^th^ anniversary of John Lewis. It was designed specifically for [Sitting Firm](//sittingfirm.co.uk) to produce and celebrates both Sitting Firm’s manufacturing capabilities and the ethos of John Lewis.

The Eliza range, named after John Lewis’ wife, demonstrates Sitting Firm’s expertise in the methods of steam bending with its double curved backrest which flows into the arms and down into the front legs. The chair is reassuring yet contemporary - modern design celebrating traditional craftsmanship and values.

*‘beautifully minimalist design’*
