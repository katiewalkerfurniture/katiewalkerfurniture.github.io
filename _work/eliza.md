The Eliza rocker is one of a range of exclusive products celebrating the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of John Lewis. It was designed specifically for [Sitting Firm](//sittingfirm.co.uk) to produce and celebrates both Sitting Firm&rsquo;s manufacturing capabilities and the ethos of John Lewis.

The Eliza range, named after John Lewis&rsquo; wife, demonstrates Sitting Firm&rsquo;s expertise in the methods of steam bending with its double curved backrest which flows into the arms and down into the front legs. The chair is reassuring yet contemporary - modern design celebrating traditional craftsmanship and values.

*&lsquo;beautifully minimalist design&rsquo;*
