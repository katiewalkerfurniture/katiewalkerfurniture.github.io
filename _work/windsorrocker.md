_720mm wide x 1020mm deep x 810mm high (28&frac14;” x 40&frac14;” x 32”)_

A wooden rocking chair available in ash with a white oil finish, walnut with a clear oil finish or oak with either a white or a clear oil finish.
Bespoke finishing options are available on request.

The chair extends the Windsor furniture making tradition. It is made by steam bending a continuous band which forms the rocker and the chair's frame. The turned sticks radiate from a carved seat out to the band making a strong, comfortable chair that remains very light. It is as at home in the nursery, as in the sitting room or home office.

A one off version is available in white oil finished ash with a woven riempie (leather) seat.
