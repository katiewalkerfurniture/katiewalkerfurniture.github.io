_1350mm wide/long x 430mm deep x 1350mm high, (53” x 17” x 53”)_

 A speculative one-off in rippled ash with a white wax oil finish.

   A seat designed for two people in 'conversation'. It is a play on the dialogue between two separate chairs when bought together - symbolised by the two high-backed ends set at opposing angles that are linked by one continuous seating plane. Perfectly sited in a bay window location, looking out and in.

   This piece is the evolution of a design resulting from a 'Creative award' given by South East Arts.
