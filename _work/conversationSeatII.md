_1350mm wide/long x 430mm deep x 1350mm high, (53&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; x 53&rdquo;)_

A one-off in rippled ash with a white wax oil finish.

A seat designed for two people in &lsquo;conversation&rsquo;. It is a play on the dialogue between two separate chairs when bought together - symbolised by the two high-backed ends set at opposing angles, both looking out and in, that are linked by one continuous seating plane.

This piece is the evolution of a design resulting from a &lsquo;Creative award&rsquo; given by South East Arts. It is now currently on show with and available from [VSOP](https://www.vsopprojects.com/ "VSOP, New York") in Greenport, New York.
