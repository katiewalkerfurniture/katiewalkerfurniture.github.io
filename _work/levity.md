Levity is a 'lighter' collection designed for leading outdoor furniture makers Gaze Burvill. The design concept of the chair was built around the interplay of two visually dominant parts: the front legs and armrest; the back legs and backrest. These two parts are connected together by a stainless steel detail between the armrest and backrest.

The table also explores the idea of two interlocking parts. In this design two arched leg sections come together to form a much stronger combined ’T’ leg section. The design also enables the table to be delivered flat and assembled on site, accommodating terrace areas with limited access.

*‘Levity expresses a new lightness of touch. Lyrical, elegant yet immensely practical.’* Simon Burvill
