The Weight & see mirror is a playful contemporary take on the traditional freestanding full length wooden cheval mirror. Simply move the highly polished stainless steel ball to change the mirrors angle. It is beautifully crafted in the UK from wood from sustainable sources and finished with a natural hard wax oil. 

In 2001 Katie was invited to take part in the One tree project and the initial concept of The Weight & See mirror was conceived. On 27 November 1998 a single large oak was felled in the National Trust estate of Tatton Park in Cheshire, England. All parts of the tree were saved and distributed to artists, craftspeople and furniture makers to make a huge range of beautiful and useful pieces. The work, including the first version of the Weight & See mirror, was brought together to form a [major exhibition](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30497439452&searchurl=kn%3D1858941334%26sortby%3D17&cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-title1 "Exhibition catalogue via ABE Books"), which travelled to five venues across Britain from August 2001 to September 2002.

Still one of our most popular designs, the mirror has gradually evolved, it is now slightly wider than it was with special editions being added for various people such as the coloured stripey ones for Paul Smith shown below and also put in an appearance on Trinny and Susannah&rsquo;s ground-breaking BBC TV show â€œWhat not to wear".
