  Ramblings of a middle aged guy working in technology in the centre of London
</p>

I used to 

* design race yachts
* partner in a multi-disciplinary design group
* consult on technology through a management consultancy
* run the technology used by one of the global fine art auction houses

but now I run a small company in the centre of London providing
software development, contract IT services, open source solutions and
general IT consulting.

I'm married to a furniture designer so expect some comments on
design *and* furniture.

I sometimes get involved in music (classical rather than rave) - I
have some strong opinions there too!
