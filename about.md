&ldquo;With a background in fine art, I set out to design furniture that has a timeless and iconic aesthetic.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Each piece in my collection is designed to raise a smile and bring pleasure to the end user.  By crafting and marrying form and tension, I aim to produce sculptural and user friendly furniture that can be enjoyed and handed down the generations.&rdquo;
