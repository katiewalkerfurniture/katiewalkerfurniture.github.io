This is nearly every working day but sometime we all have to be on location, either installing a finished piece or collecting materials for the next. We frequently welcome week-end visitors. We are easily accessed by road (we are very close to the A29), rail (Pulborough has a mainline station with direct access from London Victoria that is just a few minutes walk away) or by foot or bicycle (the South Downs National Park is less than a mile away).





Make a day of your visit: nearby towns include Arundel, Petworth and Chichester and we are very close to both Goodwood and Petworth Place. We are within easy walking distance of the South Downs National Park and the sea is just the other side.

However we cannot guarantee to always be here and so visits are best made by appointment. Please either call us on +44 7747 615323 or use our [contact page](/contact "Contact us").
