Hoop chair is a lounge chair made with a plywood formed seat upholstered with 100% natural materials, covered in a wool Boucle on a light, sustainable, hand-crafted ash wood frame.

The piece took its inspiration from both of the iconic rocking chairs in the Katie Walker Furniture range – the seating shell further explores the extents to which plywood can be formed and the ash hoop both acts as a structural member and an inviting shape for armrests to sit within. The challenge in the design was to achieve exceptional comfort whilst matching the two geometric shapes of the seating shell and the angled hoop – the shell seemingly dropped into and effortlessly supported by the hoop.

The chair is upholstered in 100% natural wool materials covered in a Boucle fabric from [Bute](https://www.butefabricsltd.com/ "Bute Fabrics, Scotland"). It can be upholstered in a fabric of your choice, needing 2.8m per chair.

The use of ply, ash and wool makes it an ecological, sustainable hand-made chair for everyday living.
