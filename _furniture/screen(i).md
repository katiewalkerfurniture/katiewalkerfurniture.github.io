_1810mm high x 1680mm wide - 3 panels of 560mm. (71&frac14;&rdquo; x 66&rdquo; - 3 panels of 22&rdquo;)_  

Screen (i) is a free standing screen or room divider consisting of three panels. Its concept is an evolution of an earlier sculptural piece inspired by a painting by Bridget Riley. It is made in ash and finished with a hardwax oil and indigo pigment. The twisting opposing coloured slats give the piece a feeling of movement that is more complex than its construction and the dominance of the colour over the natural ash changes depending on the angle viewed. The slats do not require any pre-forming - They are merely twisted into shape working with the natural structural properties of the wood when it is cut in a certain way. It is this inherent tension in the structure of the wood that enhances the expression and intention of the piece, bringing it to life. The slats are twisted in opposing directions which not only achieves the desired affect but counteracts any warping in the frame. They are held in position in locating slots in the top and bottom rails of the frames which are trimmed with a beading detail that holds the slats in place. This beading is easily removable in case any of the slats need replacing. The central indigo slat rotates around its centre with all subsequent slats twisting and leaning more and more to their respective outside vertical frame sides.
