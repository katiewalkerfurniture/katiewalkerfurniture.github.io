The Beam console is a side table or console table in oak with a white oil finish. It has a single suspended, curved fronted drawer with a cedar bottom.

It is part of the Beam range and was designed to accompany the [Beam table](beamtable.html), inspired by traditional cross-legged tables. Its structure relies on the central beam to both hold the inner legs and connect the inner legs with the outer legs giving it a lighter more playful feel. It works just as well as a stand alone piece in a hall or living area as a 'serving' table in a dining room setting.

Also in the Beam range is the [Beam bench](beambench.html).

Also available in other woods, sizes and finishes on request.
