An initimate update of Gerritt Rietveld&rsquo;s Steltman chair. The Rietveld Love seat was designed in response to seeing Rietveld&rsquo;s Steltman chair at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. The proportions of the ends of the Love seat are larger than those of the original Steltman chair and by linking two together makes the structure self supporting. It has also been adapted for use outside as well as in, being made of oak, with a slatted seat and pegged joints.
