A side table in cherry and sycamore designed for a boardroom of a company in Knightsbridge, London. This was the first design to use the staggered halving joint structure that became the theme of the earliest batch produced pieces in the Katie Walker Collection, launched in 1995 at the inaugral 100% Design Exhibition and is still in use today in the [Beam table](/furniture/beamtable.html "Beam table"), [Beam console](/furniture/beamconsole.html "Beam console") and [Beam Bench](/furniture/beambench.html "Beam bench").
