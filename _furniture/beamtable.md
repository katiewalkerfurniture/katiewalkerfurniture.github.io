_2000mm long x 950mm wide x 740mm high. (78&frac34;” x 37&frac12;” x 29”)_

A dining table made in oak with a white oil finish. This is the first piece in the Beam range, inspired by traditional cross legged refectory style tables. Separating the legs with a structure that relies on the central beam to both hold the inner legs and connect the inner legs with the outer legs gives a lighter more playful feel.

Also in the Beam range are the [Beam console](beamconsole.html) and [Beam bench](beambench.html).

Also available in other woods, sizes and finishes on request.
