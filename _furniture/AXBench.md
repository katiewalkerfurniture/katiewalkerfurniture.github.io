A one off bench in oak designed for a London terrace. The asymetrical form was created by suspending the interlocking backrest and seat slats between two frames - an A and an X. The slats moving in steps from one frame to the other.

Made from FSC sourced English oak in 1995.

This design evolved and became one of the first pieces in the Katie Walker Furniture collection. It has now been developed further and become simply ‘A’ bench which is available to order.
