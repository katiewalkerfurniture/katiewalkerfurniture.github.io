Circular tree seat, luxury outdoor seating constructed in FSC sourced European oak and finished in hard wax oil.

Available in two or three sections for a complete circle.

Constructed of three separate free standing sections joined to form a complete circle by stainless steel connecting feet and plates. For a corner sited feature it works equally well with two sections. Each third has three main frames, one at each end and one in the centre. The frames, comprising of the legs and feet, flow up to both form part of the backrest and support the other backrest slats. These frames are joined by the horizontal laminated curved beams which are then in turn connected front to back by the radiating seat and back slats. The frames are designed to both come together and blend into the form as a whole and provide punctuation between the repetition of the slats. The high back rest provides additional comfort and visual presence and the overall result is a visually simple contemporary take on the traditional tree seat.
