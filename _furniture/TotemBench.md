Totem bench, public seating commissioned by The Royal Parks Department, National Heritage for the Woodland gardens, Bushy Park, Teddington, London.

In oak and galvanised steel.

The piece was sited opposite a Canadian totem pole erected in 1992 to mark Bushy Park's link to Canadian troops stationed there in WWI, hence its references to Totem poles, eagles, flight and freedom. The radiating oak boards are cantilevered out from the central column and supported on metal plates at each end. This piece is still enjoyed by the Park's many visitors.

Before installation, this piece was exhibited on the forecourt of the Royal College of Art opposite the Royal Albert Hall, resulting in a number of commissions that kick-started the establishment of Katie Walker Furniture.

The form of this piece is one that has been explored again in the stainless steel [Winged seat](/furniture/wingedseat.html "Winged seat").
