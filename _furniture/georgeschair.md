Originally designed to accompany [George's high chair](/furniture/georgeshighchair.html "George's high chair") at the dining table, a first set in walnut was ordered for the GREAT Britain campaign headquarters at 10 Downing Street.

There are various meeting rooms at 10 Downing Street which are used by MPs, Ambassadors and the GREAT Campaign team for meetings with politicians from all over the world. GREAT has furnished these rooms with selected showcase pieces - strengthening the message to visitors that Britain is a leader in Creativity and Design. Katie Walker Furniture joined forces with Sitting Firm Chairmakers Ltd to produce this chair for the meeting rooms. Originally designed in ash with a solid wood seat, at the request of GREAT, the set of 8 chairs was produced specifically for Downing Street in walnut. The upholstery fabric (colour way selected by the GREAT team) was also supplied and produced by a British fabric company and mill.

A private commission for another set was produced in a fabulous range of timbers and fabrics.
